<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

In this report, we present an approach of Parkinson's disease(PD) prediction
using modern machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Neural Networks, XGBoost and Random Forest. We used a dataset available online
with voice variations of health individuals and patients with PD. Through correlated
measures, we selected the 10 most correlated features, then we evaluated the model
using the k-fold cross validation method leading to the best accuracy of 89.65%
using kernel support vector machine and XGBoost.

### Key Words

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [XGBoost] ()
* [Support Vector Machine]() 


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system
that aects movements and develops slowly over the years and the earlier you discover
it the best results the patients may have doing the recommended treatment. PD aects
almost a million people in North America. Currently there is no cure, however there are
several types of medication and therapy that may alleviate the symptoms. Research has
proven that approximately 90% of the people with Parkinson's has voice impairment
[6], [7]. This distortion on the voice maybe be an early stage of the illness [8] and its
measurement is a non invasive way to predict the probability of PD. To determine
if the patient presents voice impairment it is necessary to perform various sets of
tests including sustained phonations. All the speech sounds are freely available on the
internet, and they were recorded using a microphone and analyzed using measurement
methods to detect these signals [9]. All the results and parameters measured from the
vocal impairments are listed in the Table 1.

### Related Work

This project is based on the paper "Exploiting Nonlinear Recurrence and Fractal Scal-
ing Properties for Voice Disorder Detection', Little MA, McSharry PE, Roberts SJ,
Costello DAE, Moroz IM", where they present a study using nonstandard measures
(Dysphonia measurements) to discriminate healthy people from patients with Parkin-
son's disease. The authors used the same dataset, a collection of phonations from 31 people, and 23 with PD. In their work they used the most uncorrelated measures to
train the system, achieving a performance of 91.4% using kernel vector machine. The
authors use bootstrap re-sampling as a cross validation method, whereas this work
uses the 10-fold cross validation, therefore the results are not directly comparable.
The k-fold cross validation was chosen due to its popularity and reliability.
This report focuses on the work of using the same dataset, but applying three more
classification methods (XGBoost, Neural Network, Random Forest) in addition to the
Support Vector Machine (SVM), which was implemented on the mentioned paper.
