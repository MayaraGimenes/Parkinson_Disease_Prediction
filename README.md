# CISC849_FinalProject
Blog with our final project for the course CISC849

In this report, we present an approach of Parkinson's disease(PD) prediction
using modern machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM),
Neural Networks, XGBoost and Random Forest. We used a dataset available online
with voice variations of health individuals and patients with PD. Through correlated
measures, we selected the 10 most correlated features, then we evaluated the model
using the k-fold cross validation method leading to the best accuracy of 89.65%
using kernel support vector machine and XGBoost.
